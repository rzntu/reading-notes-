1. For the likelihood ration of Model M1 vs Model M0 for discrete random variable X, it is naturally to put the PMF function of the given observation into the computation. When the variable X is continuous, we can use the ratio of the model densities of X as an approximation. However, it has the assumption that the pdf function are constant within the neighborhood of x that has radius equal to the measurement precision. 

2. LR: likelihood ratio can only reveal the relative strenth of the two candidate models. For example, LR(M0, M1)=0 only shows that M0 is favored over M1. We can not say that M0 is true.
