1. For the likelihood ration of Model M1 vs Model M0 for discrete random variable X, it is naturally to put the PMF function of the given observation into the computation. When the variable X is continuous, we can use the ratio of the model densities of X as an approximation. However, it has the assumption that the pdf function are constant within the neighborhood of x that has radius equal to the measurement precision.
